# DCA Loan Dataset

This repository contains raw data, processed data, and the Jupyter Notebook used to process data on entrepreneurial loans guaranteed by the Development Credit Agency (DCA)
in low-to-middle income countries.

The purpose of this project was to gain insights into flow of DCA-guaranteed funds to entrepreneurs in developing countries. The data was cleaned using in Python within a Jupyter notebook - primarily utilizing the Pandas library.

Data processing involved cleaning the data by removing extraneous columns and cleaning out extraneous information by pattern matching (regex). The overall dataset was tidied and 
rows with missing values ommitted.

A Power BI dashboard was created in order to visualize the cleaned data.
